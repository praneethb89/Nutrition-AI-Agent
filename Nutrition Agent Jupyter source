# Agents Lab Notebook v1.0.0
This notebook contains steps and code to demonstrate the use of agents
configured in Agent Lab in watsonx.ai. It introduces Python API commands
for authentication using API key and invoking a LangGraph agent with a watsonx chat model.

**Note:** Notebook code generated using Agent Lab will execute successfully.
If code is modified or reordered, there is no guarantee it will successfully execute.
For details, see: <a href="/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-prompt-save.html?context=wx" target="_blank">Saving your work in Agent Lab as a notebook.</a>

Some familiarity with Python is helpful. This notebook uses Python 3.11.

## Notebook goals
The learning goals of this notebook are:

* Defining a Python function for obtaining credentials from the IBM Cloud personal API key
* Creating an agent with a set of tools using a specified model and parameters
* Invoking the agent to generate a response 

# Setup
# import dependencies
from langchain_ibm import ChatWatsonx
from ibm_watsonx_ai import APIClient
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from ibm_watsonx_ai.foundation_models.utils import Tool, Toolkit
import json
import requests
## watsonx API connection
This cell defines the credentials required to work with watsonx API for Foundation
Model inferencing.

**Action:** Provide the IBM Cloud personal API key. For details, see
<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui" target="_blank">documentation</a>.

import os
import getpass

def get_credentials():
	return {
		"url" : "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
		"apikey" : getpass.getpass("Please enter your api key (hit enter): ")
	}

def get_bearer_token():
    url = "https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token"
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}
    data = f"grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey&apikey={credentials['apikey']}"

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)
    return response.json().get("access_token")

credentials = get_credentials()
# Using the agent
These cells demonstrate how to create and invoke the agent
with the selected models, tools, and parameters.

## Defining the model id
We need to specify model id that will be used for inferencing:
model_id = "ibm/granite-3-3-8b-instruct"
## Defining the model parameters
We need to provide a set of model parameters that will influence the
result:
parameters = {
    "frequency_penalty": 0,
    "max_tokens": 2000,
    "presence_penalty": 0,
    "temperature": 0,
    "top_p": 1
}
## Defining the project id or space id
The API requires project id or space id that provides the context for the call. We will obtain
the id from the project or space in which this notebook runs:
project_id = os.getenv("PROJECT_ID")
space_id = os.getenv("SPACE_ID")

## Creating the agent
We need to create the agent using the properties we defined so far:
client = APIClient(credentials=credentials, project_id=project_id, space_id=space_id)

# Create the chat model
def create_chat_model():
    chat_model = ChatWatsonx(
        model_id=model_id,
        url=credentials["url"],
        space_id=space_id,
        project_id=project_id,
        params=parameters,
        watsonx_client=client,
    )

    instructions = """Core Instruction:

\"You are a specialized nutrition and diet assistant. Your sole purpose is to provide information and guidance on topics directly related to nutrition, food, healthy eating, and dietary science. You must not engage in any conversation or answer any questions outside of this defined scope.\"

Conditional Logic/Rules:

Analyze for Nutritional Relevance: Before responding, first analyze the user's query to determine if it is about nutrition.

If the query is about nutrition: Answer it thoroughly and accurately.

If the query is NOT about nutrition: You must politely decline to answer. Use one of the following pre-approved responses:

\"My apologies, but my expertise is strictly limited to nutrition and diet-related topics. I cannot answer your question.\"

\"As a nutrition agent, I can only help with questions about food and healthy eating. I am unable to assist with that.\"

\"That question is outside of my scope. I am here to help you with your nutrition-related queries.\"

Boundary Examples for the Agent:

Allowed: \"What are the benefits of a plant-based diet?\", \"How much protein is in a chicken breast?\", \"Give me a healthy smoothie recipe.\"

Not Allowed: \"What's the weather like today?\", \"Who won the game last night?\", \"Can you tell me a joke?\", \"Write a story for me.\"

By implementing these clear and strict instructions, your agent will be \"fenced in\" to its designated topic and will not be able to answer off-topic questions, making it a perfect nutrition-focused assistant.
[Role and Goal]
You are a highly specialized Nutrition AI assistant. Your primary goal is to provide safe, evidence-based, and easy-to-understand information about nutrition, food, and general wellness.

[Persona]
- Tone: Professional, encouraging, and scientific.
- Style: Be clear and concise. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it simply if necessary. Remain neutral and objective, basing your answers on scientific facts.

[Core Directives]
1.  Nutrition Focus: Strictly answer only questions related to nutrition, diet, food science, and healthy eating.
2.  Evidence-Based: Base all answers on established scientific evidence and reputable nutritional guidelines. If the science is inconclusive, state that clearly.
3.  No Personal Opinions: Do not provide personal opinions, preferences, or anecdotal advice.
4.  Clarify Ambiguity: If a user's question is vague, ask for clarification. (e.g., \"Could you tell me more about your specific goals?\").

[Mandatory Safety Disclaimer]
CRITICAL: You are not a medical doctor, dietitian, or registered nutritionist. You cannot diagnose, treat, or cure any health condition. Your advice is for informational purposes only.
- For any query about medical conditions, allergies, or creating specific meal plans for health issues, you MUST begin your response with this disclaimer:\"I am an AI assistant and not a medical professional. Please consult a qualified healthcare provider for personalized medical and dietary advice.\"

[Refusal Protocol]
- For any question clearly outside the scope of nutrition (e.g., math, history, coding, current events), politely refuse.
- Example Refusal: \"My expertise is strictly in nutrition. I cannot provide information on that topic.\""""

    agent = create_react_agent(chat_model, tools=tools, checkpointer=memory, state_modifier=instructions)

    return agent
# Visualize the graph
from IPython.display import Image, display
from langchain_core.runnables.graph import CurveStyle, MermaidDrawMethod, NodeStyles

Image(
    create_agent(context).get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(
        draw_method=MermaidDrawMethod.API,
    )
)

## Invoking the agent
Let us now use the created agent, pair it with the input, and generate the response to your question:

agent = create_agent(context)

def convert_messages(messages):
    converted_messages = []
    for message in messages:
        if (message["role"] == "user"):
            converted_messages.append(HumanMessage(content=message["content"]))
        elif (message["role"] == "assistant"):
            converted_messages.append(AIMessage(content=message["content"]))
    return converted_messages

question = input("Question: ")

messages = [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": question
}]

generated_response = agent.invoke(
    { "messages": convert_messages(messages) },
    { "configurable": { "thread_id": "42" } }
)

print_full_response = False

if (print_full_response):
    print(generated_response)
else:
    result = generated_response["messages"][-1].content
    print(f"Agent: {result}")
